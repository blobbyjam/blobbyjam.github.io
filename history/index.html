<h1>The History of Manchester United</a></h1>
<p>Manchester United are one of the most decorated football/soccer teams in the world.</p>

<p>In total, Manchester United have won:
	<ul>
		<li>20 First Division (until 1992) and Premier League titles</li>
		<li>2 Second Division titles</li>
		<li>11 F.A Cups</li>
		<li>4 League Cups</li>
		<li>20 F.A Charity/Community Shields (16 outright, 4 shared)</li>

		<li>1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</li>
		<li>1 UEFA Super Cup</li>
		<li>1 Intercontinental Cup</li>

<p>In football, there is such a thing as performing 'The Treble'. To achieve this feat in English football, you have to win the League, F.A Cup, and the Champions' League/European Cup.</p>

<p>Manchester United have achieved this once in the 1998-99 season.
<p>During an interview after winning the European Cup to achieve the treble, then manager Sir Alex Ferguson was quoted by saying, "Football, bloody hell.". Which is one of the most famous quotes in football history.
